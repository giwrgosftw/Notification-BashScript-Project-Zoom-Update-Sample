# PLEASE READ THIS FIRST!!!:
#	1. THIS SCRIPT IS A ZOOM NOTIFICATION UPDATE WHICH CHECKS IF THE USER HAS AN OLDER VERSION OF ZOOM, THEN THE NOTIFICATION PROMPTS THE USER 
#	   TO PRESS "OK" OR "LATER" OR THE "SELF-SERVICE ICON". IF PRESS "OK" OR THE "ICON", IT UPDATES AND RESTARTS ZOOM STRAIGHT AHEAD,
#	   ELSE THE NOTIFICATION WILL POP UP AGAIN AFTER x SECONDS. THE USER CAN PRESS "LATER" MAXIMUM x TIMES
#	2. THE SCRIPT SHOULD BE LOCATED IN THE APPLICATION FOLDER AND IT WILL DELETED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN THE PROCESS IS FINISHED
#	3. THE SCRIPT SHOULD START BEFORE AND WITH THE POLICY ID WHICH IT CALLS OR SHOULD RUN AS A SEPARATE POLICY
#	  (THE SCRIPT SHOULD RUN FIRST SO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU WILL CALL THE NEW POLICY - JAMF WORKS WITH ALPHABETICAL ORDER)
#	4. THE SCRIPT'S CODE DOES NOT NEED TO INCLUDE "SUDO JAMF RECON" AS JAMF CAN SET UP THIS IN THE POLICY VIA THE MAINTENANCE SECTOR (UPDATE INVENTORY)
